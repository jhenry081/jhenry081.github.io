            <h1>What goes into a blog post: My writing process</h1>
            <section id="intro">
                <p>Creating meaningful and impactful blog content involves much more than just putting words on a page.
                    As a blogger who navigates the realms of personal and professional development as well as technical
                    topics in web development and data analysis using Python, my approach is decidedly content-first.
                    This strategy ensures the substance of the post is clear and compelling before refining its
                    structure and format.</p>
                <p>Here’s a detailed look into my 7-step writing process, crafted to help you understand the meticulous
                    care that goes into each post:-</p>
            </section>
            <section id="body">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Deciding on a Topic</h3>
                        <p>Each post begins with selecting a topic that resonates with my blog's categories. Whether
                            it’s a deep dive into Python libraries, a tutorial on new web development frameworks, or
                            reflections on personal growth, the subject matter must align with my professional and
                            personal journey. This relevancy check is the first step to ensuring the content I produce
                            is not only informative but also engaging to my readers.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Brainstorming Content</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the topic is set, I brainstorm ideas and gather information from various sources
                            including web articles, existing resources in my repository, and personal experiences. This
                            phase is critical as it forms the backbone of the post, outlining major ideas, and
                            supporting details which will later evolve into well-formed paragraphs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Structuring the Post</h3>
                        <p>The initial draft begins to take shape by arranging the content into distinct sections:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Opener</strong>: Introduces the topic and hooks the reader.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Body</strong>: Delivers the main message through logically arranged
                                paragraphs, each echoing a clear, cohesive thought process.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Conclusion</strong>: Wraps up the article by summarizing the insights shared
                                and encouraging reader interaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Re-reading and revising each section ensures the narrative flows smoothly, making it easy for
                            readers to follow and absorb the information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Leveraging platform-specific features</h3>
                        <p>After the content is ready, I re-read it & add platform-specific features like profile tags,
                            Hashtags (#) & emojis for LinkedIn posts & Markdown formatting for my blog posts. This not
                            only helps in highlighting key points but also improves the overall readability of the post.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Selecting Appropriate Media</h3>
                        <p>Choosing the right media involves integrating images, videos, or infographics that complement
                            the text, providing a visual break and aiding in better understanding of the topic
                            discussed. This step varies significantly depending on the nature of the post and the
                            platform it will be published on.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Final Review</h3>
                        <p>Before a post goes live, a final review is crucial to refine the content, structure, and
                            presentation. This includes proofreading for grammar and syntax errors, ensuring the use of
                            appropriate tags and emojis where relevant, and verifying that the media used enhances the
                            post effectively.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Publishing</h3>
                        <p>Depending on the final format and the platform (like LinkedIn for professional articles or my
                            Jekyll-based blog for more detailed posts), the post might be scheduled for later or
                            published immediately. This flexibility allows for timing the release of content based on
                            reader engagement patterns and personal availability.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <h3>Tools Used:</h3>
            <p>Throughout this process, tools such as Microsoft Word and Visual Studio Code are invaluable for drafting
                and coding up content, respectively. The choice of platform, whether it’s a professional network like
                LinkedIn or my personal blog, influences the style and depth of the post due to the differing audience
                expectations and engagement strategies suitable for each.</p>

            <section id="end">
                <h3>Conclusion </h3>
                <p>By adhering to this structured approach, I not only streamline the creation of each blog post but
                    also ensure that the content delivered is thoughtful, relevant, and polished. This methodical
                    process helps in crafting posts that not only capture attention but also provide substantial value,
                    fostering a connection with the audience that keeps them wanting to read more.
